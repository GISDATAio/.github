Geodatadownloader (GDD) is client-side browser application that will download all the data contained in an ArcGIS feature layer onto your computer. It is not limited by max query size, and can download any size dataset (yes that includes those huge parcel layers from your local county). You can choose a custom extent for your download, and pick the output columns you want to use.
